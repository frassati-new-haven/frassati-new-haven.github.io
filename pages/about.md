Frasasti New Haven is a fellowship of young adult Catholics (and interested non-Catholics) in their 20's and 30's who desire to gather together to worship the Lord, grow in their faith, serve those in need, and build bonds of authentic friendship. Impelled by the Holy Spirit, we have heard the call to become the saints of our generation and are motivated to allow God's grace to change us so that we, in turn, might change the world.

We strive to accomplish this mission by focusing on prayer, service, and fellowship. In doing so, we follow the example of Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati. To learn more about Frassati, visit [frassatiusa.org](http://frassatiusa.org).
